Analyze the following Pokémon Blue screen and provide a detailed, unambiguous description of the game state.
Consider the following aspects:
1. **Screen Text:** List all visible text (dialogue, menu headers, option labels).
2. **Location & Movement:** Describe where the player is (e.g., "in the center of Viridian City", "top-left corner of the overworld") and list available movement directions (e.g., "can move UP and LEFT, but blocked on the RIGHT").
3. **Menu State:** Indicate if a menu is open and, if so, specify which menu (e.g., "Party Menu", "Item Inventory", "Battle Menu"). List key options visible.
4. **Battle Context:** If in battle, specify whether it is a wild Pokémon battle or a trainer battle, and note the names/HP of the Pokémon if visible.
5. **Other Cues:** Note if the player is near an NPC, facing a wall or obstacle, or in an area that requires puzzle solving.
Provide your description in plain, clear language. Do not include any extra commentary or formatting tags.
                     ASSISTANT: The screen displays a text-based environment, likely a virtual environment, with various options and information. The text is displayed in a black color, and the environment appears to be a computer-generated space.

There are no visible Pokémon or other characters in the scene. The focus is on the text and the options provided. The environment seems to be a mix of a computer-generated space and a text-based interface.
